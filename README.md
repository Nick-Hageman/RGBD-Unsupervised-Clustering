<h1>Unsupervised RGB-D Scene Clustering</h1>

[![Technologies Used](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=pytorch,py)](https://skillicons.dev)

We wanted to be able to cluster scenes from a short film (Monkaa) using RGB-D data. With a project requirement of being unsupervised, we made sure not to include the ground truth labels from the data. The reason we are including the depth information for our clustering is because we thought it may enhance the scene representation in regards to spatial relationships and objects in the scene. There are many real world applications that utilize 3D data including AR/VR and robotics & navigation.
